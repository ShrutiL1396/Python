Machine Learning Basics
========================


The Machine Learning Models folder consists of a certain case studies which would demonstrate basic working of Machine Learning algorithms.
These algorithms fall under the Supervised and Unsupervised Learning categories respectively.
The demonstration of the accuracy of each of the models has been mentioned as well for reference.
