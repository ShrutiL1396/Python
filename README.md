Python is an indispensible tool which is often used to perform initial data cleaning, data wrangling to gather insights from data and to eventually build machine learning models. This repository exploring various aspects of python for data analytics and machine learning.

## Description
There are various subdirectories under this repository which aim to demonstrate the the usage of python for Data pre-processing, Feature Engineering, Data Visualisation and Machine Learning.
Data pre-processing often involves performing preliminary analysis on the given dataset. We have dealt with structured data throughout and performed cleaning of the data to ensure  understand the statistical distribution of data, the correct data-types are assigned to columns,
handle null values using various strategies, perfom encoding, etc. Visualization of the insights gathered throughout the our data pre-processing stage is indespensible. Seaborn, Matplotlib and Plotly serve as great tools for visualizing the data.
Lastly few Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning models have been built for various problems. 

### Prerequisites and Installation
We have utilised a plethora of libraries throughout these projects under **Python 3.8 and onwards**, however the popularly used libraries and packages are:-
- numpy
``` 
pip install numpy
```
- pandas 
```
pip install pandas
```
- seaborn
``` 
pip install seaborn
```
- matplotlib
``` 
pip install matplotlib
```
- plotly
``` 
pip install plotly
```
- scikitlearn
``` 
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
