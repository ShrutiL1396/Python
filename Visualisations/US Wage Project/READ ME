In this project, the US Prevailing Wage Program data from 2011-2020 is being assessed. 

To understand what information this massive dataset is portraying, we have first cleaned the individual excel files dedicated to each year and combined the 
common features of those files and created single dataset for better comparison.

The visuals are created in this project using Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly.
